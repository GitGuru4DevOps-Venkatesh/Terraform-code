# Terraform Usage Guide: Here are the steps a user or company would follow to use the Terraform code effectively:

## Step 1: Review Requirements
Before starting, review the requirements for your web application and DevOps environment. Identify the necessary tools and infrastructure components for development, testing, and deployment.

## Step 2: Set Up AWS Account
Ensure you have an AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources. Sign up at AWS if you don't have an account. if not create at https://aws.amazon.com/

## Step 3: Install Terraform
Install Terraform on your local machine from the official website https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html. Follow the installation guide for your operating system.

## Step 4: Prepare SSH Key Pair
Create an SSH key pair for EC2 instance access. Use the `ssh-keygen` command or specify an existing key in the Terraform variables.

## Step 5: Customize Variables
Edit the `main.tf` file to update variables like `ssh_key_name`, `ami_id`, `instance_type`, `subnet_id`, and `db_password` to suit your environment.

## Step 6: Review Resource Definitions
Check the resource definitions in `main.tf` to ensure they match your infrastructure needs. Adjust as necessary.

## Step 7: Initialize Terraform
Run `terraform init` in the terminal within the Terraform file directory to prepare the working directory.

## Step 8: Plan Infrastructure
Use `terraform plan` to review the actions Terraform will perform. Ensure the plan aligns with your expectations.

## Step 9: Apply Configuration
Execute `terraform apply` to deploy your infrastructure. Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

## Step 10: Monitor Deployment
Observe the Terraform process as it creates and configures AWS resources. Stay alert for status updates and potential issues.

## Step 11: Access Provisioned Resources
After deployment, access resources like Jenkins, SonarQube, Prometheus, Grafana, RDS, and EKS via their endpoints or IPs.

## Step 12: Verify Configuration
Test the deployment pipeline, monitor application performance, and confirm the correct configuration of all components.

Following these steps will help you effectively use Terraform code to establish a DevOps environment on AWS for your web applications. Customize the configuration to meet your specific needs and utilize Terraform's automation features to streamline infrastructure provisioning.
